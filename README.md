# HoriseonCodeRefractorChallenge
# Code Refactor Starter Code

##Purpose 

The purpose of this project is to fix up some broken code for a mock company. I added titles to all the pictures and stopped the display from showing on logo at the bottom of the page. 

##Usage 

This website is just an introductory page for a company that probably does some type of consulting in the tech industry. The website mostly just displays information about the company. 


##License: I don't know the license that was used on this code off of the top of my head.
